        <h1>1. Ancient Mexico</h1>

        <h2>Introduction: The Three Super-Areas</h2>
        <p>The history of Ancient Mexico is defined not by modern borders, but by three distinct cultural and geographical "super-areas": <strong>Aridoamerica</strong>, <strong>Oasisamerica</strong>, and <strong>Mesoamerica</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Aridoamerica occupied the central and northeastern regions</strong> of present-day Mexico and the southern United States. Due to the arid, hostile environment, the inhabitants remained hunter-gatherers and nomads who did not develop agriculture or monumental architecture. They lived in caves or temporary camps, relying on scarce resources.</p>

        <p><strong>Oasisamerica covered parts of the northwest</strong> Mexico. Here, communities developed a semi-agricultural lifestyle by utilizing intricate irrigation systems to farm in dry climates. While they built settlements (such as Paquimé), they remained distinct from the complex civilizations to the south.</p>

        <p><strong>Mesoamerica</strong> is the focus of the majority of this historical period. <strong>Located in the central and southern</strong> parts of Mexico and Central America, this fertile region allowed for the development of high civilizations. Mesoamerica is defined by shared cultural traits among various peoples, including the cultivation of maize (corn), beans, and squash; the use of a ritual calendar; human sacrifice; stratified societies; and the construction of stepped pyramids.</p>

        <h2>Origins and the Preclassic Period (<strong>2500 BC – 200 AD</strong>)</h2>
        <p>The history of Mesoamerica begins with the domestication of maize around <strong>5000 BC</strong>, which gradually transformed nomadic bands into sedentary agriculturalists. By <strong>2500 BC</strong>, permanent villages were established, marking the start of the <strong>Preclassic period</strong>.</p>

        <p>During the <strong>Middle Preclassic</strong> (<strong>1200–400 BC</strong>), the <strong>Olmec</strong> civilization emerged in the Gulf Coast region (<strong>Tabasco</strong> and <strong>Veracruz</strong>). Often considered the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica, the Olmecs developed the first complex political centers at <strong>San Lorenzo</strong> and <strong>La Venta</strong>. They are famous for their colossal stone heads, jade carving, and earthen pyramids. The Olmecs did not build an empire, but their cultural influence—including their art style and religious concepts—spread throughout Mesoamerica, influencing developing societies in <strong>Oaxaca</strong> and the <strong>Central Highlands</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Classic Period (<strong>200 AD – 650/900 AD</strong>)</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Classic period</strong> is characterized by the rise of urbanism, population growth, and the consolidation of large states.</p>

        <p>In the Central Highlands, <strong>Teotihuacan</strong> grew into a massive metropolis, housing perhaps 100,000 people at its peak. It was the most powerful city of its time, dominated by the <strong>Pyramid of the Sun</strong> and the <strong>Pyramid of the Moon</strong>. Teotihuacan was not just a commercial hub but a religious center that exerted political and cultural influence as far away as the Maya region.</p>

        <p>Simultaneously, the <strong>Zapotecs</strong> in Oaxaca built the hilltop city of <strong>Monte Albán</strong>, while the <strong>Maya</strong> civilization flourished in the southeast (<strong>Chiapas</strong>, <strong>Yucatán</strong>, <strong>Guatemala</strong>). Unlike Teotihuacan's centralized empire, the Maya were organized into competing city-states (such as <strong>Tikal</strong>, <strong>Calakmul</strong>, and <strong>Palenque</strong>). The Maya achieved the highest intellectual peaks of Ancient Mexico, developing a complex writing system, precise astronomical knowledge, and the "Long Count" calendar.</p>

        <p>The Classic period ended in collapse. Teotihuacan was burned and abandoned around <strong>650 AD</strong>, likely due to internal revolt and weakened trade. The Maya cities of the southern lowlands followed suit around <strong>900 AD</strong> due to ecological exhaustion and endemic warfare.</p>

        <h2>The Epiclassic and Postclassic Periods (<strong>650 AD – 1519 AD</strong>)</h2>
        <p>Following the fall of Teotihuacan, Mesoamerica entered the <strong>Epiclassic</strong>, a time of political fragmentation and instability. Regional centers like <strong>Xochicalco</strong> and <strong>Cacaxtla</strong> fought for dominance, filling the power vacuum.</p>

        <p>By <strong>900 AD</strong>, the <strong>Postclassic period</strong> began. This era is distinguished by increased militarism, the migration of northern hunters (<strong>Chichimecas</strong>) into Mesoamerica, and a focus on war and sacrifice. The <strong>Toltecs</strong> established their capital at <strong>Tula</strong> (<strong>Hidalgo</strong>). The Toltecs were viewed by later civilizations as the epitome of civilization, combining the fierceness of the warrior with the refinement of the artist.</p>

        <h2>The Mexica (The Aztecs)</h2>
        <p>The final stage of Ancient Mexico belongs to the <strong>Mexicas</strong> (commonly known as the <strong>Aztecs</strong>). Originally a semi-nomadic tribe from the mythical <strong>Aztlán</strong>, they arrived in the Basin of Mexico late, finding the best land already occupied. Despised by established groups, they were forced to settle on a small, swampy island in <strong>Lake Texcoco</strong> in <strong>1325</strong>, founding the city of <strong>Tenochtitlan</strong>.</p>

        <p>Through strategic marriages and military prowess, the Mexicas rose from mercenaries to imperial rulers. In <strong>1428</strong>, they formed the <strong>Triple Alliance</strong> with the cities of <strong>Texcoco</strong> and <strong>Tlacopan</strong>. This alliance conquered vast territories, stretching from the Gulf to the Pacific.</p>

        <p>The Mexica state was built on tribute and religion. Conquered peoples were forced to pay heavy taxes in goods (cotton, feathers, cacao) and provide captives for human sacrifice. The Mexicas believed that the sun god, <strong>Huitzilopochtli</strong>, required human blood to sustain the universe and prevent the end of the world.</p>

        <p>By the early 16th century, Tenochtitlan was a marvel of engineering, featuring causeways, aqueducts, and a massive marketplace. However, the empire was fragile. The heavy demands of tribute created deep resentment among subject peoples (such as the <strong>Tlaxcalans</strong>). When the Spanish arrived in <strong>1519</strong>, they found a Mesoamerica that was politically divided, allowing them to exploit these internal enmities to topple the Mexica empire, bringing the era of Ancient Mexico to a close.</p>
