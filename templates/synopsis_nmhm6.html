        <h1>6. The Revolution (1910 – 1920)</h1>

        <h2>Introduction: A Violent Transformation</h2>
        <p>The author presents the <strong>Mexican Revolution</strong> not as a single, unified event, but as a complex sequence of conflicts involving distinct regions, social classes, and political projects. What began as a political rebellion by the middle and upper classes to establish democracy evolved into a profound social upheaval driven by peasants and workers, finally concluding with the establishment of a new, powerful state led by a victorious middle-class military faction from the north.</p>

        <h2>The Maderista Revolution (1910–1913)</h2>
        <p>The conflict began with the <strong>Plan of San Luis Potosí</strong>, issued by <strong>Francisco I. Madero</strong> after the fraudulent <strong>1910</strong> election. Madero called for an uprising on <strong>November 20, 1910</strong>. While the initial response was scattered, the movement gained traction in the north (<strong>Chihuahua</strong>) with leaders like <strong>Pascual Orozco</strong> and <strong>Pancho Villa</strong>, and in the south (<strong>Morelos</strong>) with <strong>Emiliano Zapata</strong>.</p>

        <p>The capture of <strong>Ciudad Juárez</strong> by revolutionary forces in <strong>May 1911</strong> forced <strong>Porfirio Díaz</strong> to sign the <strong>Treaty of Ciudad Juárez</strong>, resign, and go into exile. An interim government was set up, and Madero was overwhelmingly elected president later that year.</p>

        <p>However, Madero's presidency was doomed by his attempt to govern with the old structures intact. He demobilized the revolutionary troops while keeping the <strong>Federal Army</strong> (the institution of the dictatorship) to maintain order. This alienated his revolutionary allies.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emiliano Zapata</strong> rebelled almost immediately (<strong>Plan of Ayala</strong>), demanding immediate restoration of village lands, which Madero—a legalist who believed in court procedures—moved too slowly on.</li>
            <li><strong>Pascual Orozco</strong> also rebelled in the north, feeling underappreciated.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously, the old Porfirian elites and the press attacked Madero for being "weak" and unable to control the country.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In <strong>February 1913</strong>, a military coup known as the <strong>Decena Trágica (Ten Tragic Days)</strong> took place in <strong>Mexico City</strong>. General <strong>Victoriano Huerta</strong>, whom Madero had trusted to defend him, betrayed the president. Madero and his Vice President were arrested and assassinated. Huerta declared himself president, aiming to restore the old Porfirian order.</p>

        <h2>The Constitutionalist Struggle (1913–1914)</h2>
        <p>The assassination of Madero galvanized the country against Huerta. The resistance was led by <strong>Venustiano Carranza</strong>, the governor of <strong>Coahuila</strong>. In his <strong>Plan of Guadalupe</strong>, Carranza accused Huerta of being a usurper. He did not initially promise major social reforms; his goal was legalistic—to restore the constitutional order. He declared himself the <strong>"First Chief"</strong> of the <strong>Constitutionalist Army</strong>.</p>

        <p>A massive, multi-front war ensued against Huerta, involving three major northern armies and one southern one:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Northwest Corps</strong>: Led by <strong>Álvaro Obregón</strong> (<strong>Sonora</strong>). They were pragmatic, middle-class, and militarily efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>The Division of the North</strong>: Led by <strong>Pancho Villa</strong> (<strong>Chihuahua</strong>). A massive, popular army of cowboys, ranch hands, and drifters. Villa was a charismatic populist who confiscated haciendas to fund his army.</li>
            <li><strong>The Northeast Corps</strong>: Led by <strong>Pablo González</strong> (under <strong>Carranza's</strong> direct supervision).</li>
            <li><strong>The Zapatistas</strong>: In the south, <strong>Zapata</strong> continued his independent guerrilla war for land reform.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Facing these combined forces—and facing diplomatic hostility from the United States (which occupied the port of Veracruz in <strong>1914</strong>)—Huerta's regime collapsed. He resigned in <strong>July 1914</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The War of Factions (1914–1915)</h2>
        <p>With the common enemy gone, the revolutionary coalition fractured. The question arose: What kind of new nation would be built?</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Conventionists</strong>: <strong>Villa</strong> and <strong>Zapata</strong> met at the <strong>Convention of Aguascalientes</strong>. They represented the popular, agrarian, and regionalist wing of the Revolution. They wanted immediate land redistribution and weak central government. They occupied <strong>Mexico City</strong> briefly, famously posing for a photo in the presidential chair.</li>
            <li><strong>The Constitutionalists</strong>: <strong>Carranza</strong> and <strong>Obregón</strong> represented the nationalist, middle-class, and state-building wing. They wanted a strong central government and secular modernization.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The civil war between these former allies was the bloodiest phase of the Revolution. The turning point came in <strong>1915</strong> at the <strong>Battles of Celaya</strong>. Obregón, utilizing modern tactics learned from <strong>World War I</strong> (trenches, machine guns, and barbed wire), decimated Villa's famous cavalry charges. Villa retreated to the north to wage guerrilla warfare, and Zapata was contained in the south. The Constitutionalists had won.</p>

        <h2>The Constitution of 1917</h2>
        <p>Victorious, Carranza convened a congress in <strong>Querétaro</strong> to draft a new constitution. While Carranza presented a moderate draft, the radical "Jacobin" wing of his followers pushed for a document that went much further. The resulting <strong>Constitution of 1917</strong> was the most advanced in the world at the time. It enshrined the demands of the Revolution into law:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Article 3</strong>: Established secular, state-controlled education, limiting the power of the Church.</li>
            <li><strong>Article 27</strong>: Declared that the nation was the original owner of all lands and waters. It authorized the state to seize land for redistribution (land reform) and asserted national ownership of subsoil resources (oil and minerals), challenging foreign companies.</li>
            <li><strong>Article 123</strong>: Established radical labor rights, including the eight-hour workday, the right to strike, and a minimum wage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Carranza Presidency and the Rise of Sonora (1917–1920)</h2>
        <p>Carranza became the first constitutional president of the new regime. However, his government was plagued by difficulties. The economy was ruined, the <strong>Spanish Flu</strong> pandemic hit, and pacification was incomplete. Carranza famously ordered the assassination of <strong>Emiliano Zapata</strong> in <strong>1919</strong> to crush the southern resistance.</p>

        <p>As the <strong>1920</strong> election approached, Carranza attempted to impose a civilian successor (<strong>Ignacio Bonillas</strong>) to prevent the rise of the military generals, specifically <strong>Álvaro Obregón</strong>. This proved to be a fatal miscalculation.</p>

        <p>The <strong>"Sonoran Triangle"</strong>—Generals <strong>Álvaro Obregón</strong>, <strong>Plutarco Elías Calles</strong>, and <strong>Adolfo de la Huerta</strong>—rebelled under the <strong>Plan of Agua Prieta</strong>. The army overwhelmingly supported <strong>Obregón</strong>, the hero of <strong>Celaya</strong>. Carranza was forced to flee <strong>Mexico City</strong> and was assassinated in the mountains of <strong>Puebla</strong> in <strong>May 1920</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: The End of the Armed Struggle</h2>
        <p>The death of Carranza and the ascent of the <strong>Sonoran</strong> group marked the end of the violent phase of the Revolution. The Sonorans were pragmatists who understood the need to rebuild the state and economy. They incorporated the surviving Zapatistas and other factions into the government, pacified the country, and began the long process of institutionalizing the Revolution. The era of warlords was ending; the era of institutions was beginning.</p>
