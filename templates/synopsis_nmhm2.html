        <h1>2. The Colonial Era to 1760</h1>

        <h2>Introduction: The Foundation of New Spain</h2>
        <p>The Colonial Era is defined not merely by Spanish domination, but by the forging of a new political and social entity: <strong>New Spain</strong> (<strong>Nueva España</strong>). This period, lasting roughly three centuries, established the geographical, political, and cultural roots of modern Mexico. It was a time of colliding worlds, where Mesoamerican structures were not immediately erased but rather adapted and overlaid by European institutions.</p>

        <h2>The Conquest and Continuity (<strong>1519–1550</strong>)</h2>
        <p>The narrative begins with the fall of <strong>Tenochtitlan</strong> in <strong>1521</strong>. However, the author emphasizes that the Conquest was not a sudden, total rupture. The Spanish were few in number and could not rule the vast territory alone. To maintain control, they relied heavily on the existing Mesoamerican political structures, specifically the <strong>Altepetl</strong> (indigenous city-states/lordships).</p>

        <p><strong>Cortés</strong> and the early conquistadors utilized the <strong>Encomienda system</strong>. The Spanish Crown granted a conquistador (the <strong>encomendero</strong>) the right to receive tribute and labor from a specific altepetl. In exchange, the encomendero was responsible for the military protection and religious conversion of the inhabitants. Crucially, the indigenous rulers (<strong>caciques</strong>) remained in power to manage their communities and collect this tribute. For many indigenous commoners, the early colonial period meant a change of masters—from the Aztec Emperor to the Spanish King—but their daily lives and local hierarchies remained largely intact.</p>

        <p>Simultaneously, the <strong>Spiritual Conquest</strong> began. Friars from the mendicant orders—<strong>Franciscans</strong>, <strong>Dominicans</strong>, and <strong>Augustinians</strong>—arrived to convert the population. They served as the primary bridge between the two cultures, learning indigenous languages and often protecting the natives from the excesses of the conquistadors. They oversaw the construction of churches and monasteries, often built atop pre-Hispanic temples, physically symbolizing the imposition of the new faith.</p>

        <h2>Institutionalizing the Colony (<strong>1550–1600</strong>)</h2>
        <p>By the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown sought to curb the power of the conquistadors, fearing they would become feudal lords independent of Spain. The Crown established the <strong>Viceroyalty</strong> in <strong>1535</strong>, with <strong>Antonio de Mendoza</strong> as the first Viceroy, representing the King's personal authority. High courts known as <strong>Audiencias</strong> were created to administer justice and check the Viceroy's power.</p>

        <p>This era witnessed a catastrophic demographic collapse. Old World diseases (smallpox, measles, and <strong>cocoliztli</strong>), against which the natives had no immunity, decimated the indigenous population. It is estimated that the population dropped by up to <strong>90%</strong> during the <strong>16th century</strong>. This depopulation shattered the encomienda system; there were simply not enough people left to provide free labor.</p>

        <p>As a result, the economy shifted. The Spanish introduced <strong>haciendas</strong> (large landed estates) and began using wage labor. They also transformed the landscape with European agriculture (wheat, citrus) and, most significantly, livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and pigs), which roamed vast tracts of land that had previously been densely populated.</p>

        <h2>The Two Republics and the Economy</h2>
        <p>Legally, society was divided into two spheres: the <strong>Republic of Indians</strong> (<strong>República de Indios</strong>) and the <strong>Republic of Spaniards</strong> (<strong>República de Españoles</strong>).</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Republic of Indians</strong> consisted of indigenous communities reorganized into "<strong>pueblos de indios</strong>." These towns had their own semi-autonomous governments but were subject to tribute and the supervision of the church.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Republic of Spaniards</strong> included not just European-born Spaniards (<strong>Peninsulares</strong>), but also White Spaniards born in Mexico (<strong>Criollos</strong>), mixed-race individuals (<strong>Mestizos</strong>), and Africans brought as slaves. These groups lived in cities and mining camps, governed by Spanish town councils (<strong>Ayuntamientos</strong>).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The economic engine of New Spain became silver mining. The discovery of massive silver deposits in the north (<strong>Zacatecas</strong>, <strong>Guanajuato</strong>) turned New Spain into the crown jewel of the Spanish Empire. A global trade network emerged: silver flowed to Spain and China, while Asian goods (silk, porcelain) arrived in <strong>Acapulco</strong> via the <strong>Manila Galleon</strong>, and European goods entered through <strong>Veracruz</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Expansion to the North</h2>
        <p>While the center and south of Mexico were built upon sedentary Mesoamerican foundations, the North (<strong>Aridoamerica</strong>) was different. The "<strong>Chichimeca</strong>" nomads fiercely resisted Spanish encroachment. The <strong>Chichimeca War</strong> lasted for decades. Eventually, the Spanish realized they could not win by force alone. They adopted a strategy of "peace by purchase," providing food and goods to nomadic groups to encourage them to settle. The colonization of the North was driven by miners, ranchers, and <strong>Jesuit</strong> missionaries, creating a culture distinct from the center—more mobile, less stratified, and heavily reliant on armed self-defense.</p>

        <h2>The Age of Integration (17th Century)</h2>
        <p>The period from roughly <strong>1600 to 1700</strong> is described as a time of autonomy and maturity. As the indigenous population slowly began to recover and the Mestizo (mixed-race) population exploded, the strict separation of the "Two Republics" began to blur.</p>

        <p>Politically, the Spanish Empire was weakening under the <strong>Hapsburg</strong> kings, meaning New Spain enjoyed significant de facto independence. Much of the silver wealth produced in Mexico stayed in Mexico, funding the construction of magnificent Baroque cathedrals, universities, and palaces. This was the era of the Baroque, exemplified by the literary genius of <strong>Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</strong>.</p>

        <p>A distinct <strong>Criollo</strong> consciousness emerged. The Criollos (Spanish descendents born in Mexico) began to resent the privileges of the Peninsulares. They developed a sense of pride in their American homeland, claiming a unique identity rooted in the veneration of the <strong>Virgin of Guadalupe</strong>, who became the unifying symbol of New Spain—a brown-skinned Virgin appearing to an indigenous man, bridging the gap between the conquerors and the conquered.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Transition to the Bourbons</h2>
        <p>By <strong>1700</strong>, the Spanish <strong>Hapsburg</strong> dynasty died out and was replaced by the French <strong>House of Bourbon</strong>. Initially, this dynastic change had little impact on the colony. However, as the 18th century progressed, the new monarchy began to view New Spain less as a sister kingdom and more as a resource to be exploited for the benefit of the motherland. By <strong>1760</strong>, the colonial system was stable, wealthy, and culturally distinct, but the seeds of change were being sown as the Crown prepared to tighten its grip, setting the stage for the reforms and resentment that would eventually lead to independence.</p>
