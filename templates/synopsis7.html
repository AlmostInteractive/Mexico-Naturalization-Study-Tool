        <h1>7. The Last Stretch (1929 – 2000)</h1>

        <h2>Introduction: From Caudillos to Institutions</h2>
        <p>This final section covers the consolidation of the post-revolutionary state and its eventual transformation. If the previous era was defined by violence and armed warlords (<strong>caudillos</strong>), this era is defined by the creation of institutions and the dominance of a single political party. <strong>Aboites Aguilar</strong> describes a journey from a rural, illiterate, and agrarian <strong>Mexico</strong> in <strong>1929</strong> to an urban, industrial, and increasingly democratic nation by <strong>2000</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Formation of the System (1929–1940)</h2>
        <p>The narrative begins with the assassination of <strong>Álvaro Obregón</strong> in <strong>1928</strong>, which threatened to plunge the country back into civil war. To prevent this, the outgoing president, <strong>Plutarco Elías Calles</strong>, proposed a political solution: the creation of a national party to resolve conflicts and succession disputes peacefully.</p>

        <p>In <strong>1929</strong>, the <strong>National Revolutionary Party (PNR)</strong> was founded. This coalition brought together the various regional bosses, military generals, and labor organizations under one umbrella. For the next few years (the <strong>Maximato</strong>), <strong>Calles</strong> remained the <strong>"Maximum Chief,"</strong> controlling puppet presidents from behind the scenes.</p>

        <p>This dynamic changed with the election of <strong>Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–1940)</strong>. <strong>Cárdenas</strong> is a pivotal figure who broke with <strong>Calles</strong>, sending him into exile. <strong>Cárdenas</strong> then implemented the most radical social goals of the Revolution:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Agrarian Reform: He redistributed roughly 18 million hectares of land to peasant communities (<strong>ejidos</strong>), effectively destroying the traditional hacienda system.</li>
            <li>Labor Rights: He supported the formation of powerful unions, such as the <strong>CTM (Confederation of Mexican Workers)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Oil Expropriation: In <strong>1938</strong>, following a labor dispute with foreign oil companies, <strong>Cárdenas</strong> nationalized the oil industry, creating <strong>PEMEX</strong>. This act became a central pillar of Mexican nationalism.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Cárdenas</strong> reorganized the party into the <strong>Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM)</strong>, structuring it into "sectors" (peasant, labor, military, and popular). This corporatist structure allowed the state to manage and control the masses, ensuring loyalty in exchange for benefits.</p>

        <h2>The "Mexican Miracle" (1940–1970)</h2>
        <p>Following <strong>Cárdenas</strong>, the regime shifted to the right. <strong>World War II</strong> provided a golden opportunity for <strong>Mexico</strong>; the U.S. needed raw materials and labor, leading to the <strong>Bracero</strong> program and a boom in exports.</p>

        <p>Successive presidents (<strong>Ávila Camacho</strong>, <strong>Alemán</strong>, <strong>Ruiz Cortines</strong>, <strong>López Mateos</strong>, and <strong>Díaz Ordaz</strong>) focused on industrialization rather than agriculture. They adopted a policy of <strong>Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI)</strong>, using high tariffs to protect domestic industries.</p>

        <p>This period is known as the <strong>"Mexican Miracle"</strong> or <strong>"Stabilizing Development."</strong> The economy grew at an average of 6% annually for decades with low inflation. <strong>Mexico</strong> transformed from a rural country into an urban one, with <strong>Mexico City</strong> becoming a massive metropolis. The middle class expanded, gaining access to social security, universities, and housing. In <strong>1946</strong>, the ruling party changed its name one last time to the <strong>Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)</strong>, symbolizing that the revolution was now a permanent government institution.</p>

        <p>However, this stability came at a cost: Authoritarianism. The <strong>PRI</strong> maintained a monopoly on power. Opposition was tolerated only as a token; real power lay with the President. Unions and peasant organizations were co-opted and corrupt (<strong>charros</strong>).</p>

        <p>The cracks in the system appeared in the late 1960s. The expanding middle class and university students began to demand democratic freedoms. This tension exploded in <strong>1968</strong>, just before <strong>Mexico City</strong> hosted the Olympics. The government, intolerant of dissent, massacred student protesters at the <strong>Plaza de Tlatelolco</strong> on <strong>October 2</strong>. This tragedy destroyed the moral legitimacy of the <strong>PRI</strong>, separating the state from the intellectual class and the youth.</p>

        <h2>Populism and Economic Crisis (1970–1982)</h2>
        <p>In the 1970s, Presidents <strong>Luis Echeverría</strong> and <strong>José López Portillo</strong> attempted to regain the regime's lost legitimacy through massive public spending and populist rhetoric. They expanded the bureaucracy and bought failing private companies to save jobs.</p>

        <p>Initially, this seemed sustainable due to the discovery of massive oil reserves (<strong>Cantarell</strong>) in the <strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong>. <strong>Mexico</strong> bet everything on high oil prices, borrowing billions of dollars from international banks against future oil revenues.</p>

        <p>The gamble failed. In <strong>1981–1982</strong>, oil prices collapsed while interest rates in the U.S. skyrocketed. <strong>Mexico</strong> could no longer pay its debts. In a desperate final act, <strong>López Portillo</strong> nationalized the banking system in <strong>September 1982</strong>, blaming bankers for the capital flight. The <strong>"Mexican Miracle"</strong> was officially dead, replaced by the <strong>"Lost Decade"</strong> of inflation and stagnation.</p>

        <h2>The Neoliberal Turn and Transition (1982–2000)</h2>
        <p>The crisis of <strong>1982</strong> ushered in a new group of leaders: the <strong>Technocrats</strong>. These were economists often educated in the U.S. (Ivy League), who believed the protectionist, state-heavy model was obsolete. Presidents <strong>Miguel de la Madrid</strong>, <strong>Carlos Salinas de Gortari</strong>, and <strong>Ernesto Zedillo</strong> dismantled the revolutionary nationalist state.</p>

        <p>They implemented Neoliberal policies:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Privatization of hundreds of state-owned companies (including the banks and the telephone company).</li>
            <li>Opening the country to foreign trade, culminating in the <strong>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA/TLCAN)</strong> in <strong>1994</strong>.</li>
            <li>Modification of <strong>Article 27</strong> to end land redistribution and allow the sale of <strong>ejido</strong> land.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Politically, the <strong>PRI's</strong> grip was slipping. The <strong>1988</strong> election was a watershed moment. <strong>Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas</strong> (son of <strong>Lázaro</strong>) broke from the <strong>PRI</strong> and led a massive leftist coalition. On election night, the computer system "crashed" while <strong>Cárdenas</strong> was leading; when it came back up, the <strong>PRI</strong> candidate, <strong>Carlos Salinas</strong>, was declared the winner. The widespread belief in fraud galvanized civil society.</p>

        <p><strong>1994</strong> proved to be a traumatic year. On <strong>January 1</strong>, the day <strong>NAFTA</strong> went into effect, the <strong>Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)</strong> rose up in <strong>Chiapas</strong>, highlighting the poverty of indigenous people left behind by neoliberalism. Later that year, the <strong>PRI's</strong> presidential candidate, <strong>Luis Donaldo Colosio</strong>, was assassinated. Shortly after <strong>Ernesto Zedillo</strong> took office, the economy crashed again (the <strong>"December Mistake"</strong>), causing the peso to lose half its value.</p>

        <h2>The End of the System</h2>
        <p>The economic crises and corruption scandals made democratic change inevitable. President <strong>Zedillo</strong> implemented electoral reforms that gave true independence to the <strong>Federal Electoral Institute (IFE)</strong>.</p>

        <p>In the <strong>2000</strong> election, for the first time in 71 years, the <strong>PRI</strong> lost. <strong>Vicente Fox</strong>, the candidate of the conservative <strong>National Action Party (PAN)</strong>, won the presidency. <strong>Aboites Aguilar</strong> concludes that while the arrival of democracy was a monumental achievement, the new millennium found <strong>Mexico</strong> facing old and persistent challenges: deep poverty, inequality, violence, and the difficult integration into a globalized world. The book ends with the image of a <strong>Mexico</strong> that has modernized and democratized, but has yet to solve the fundamental issues of social justice that sparked the Revolution a century earlier.</p>
