        <h1>4. From Independence to the Consolidation of the Republic (1821 - 1876)</h1>

        <h2>Introduction: The Difficult Birth of a Nation</h2>
        <p>Mexico achieved its independence in <strong>1821</strong> with high hopes, believing that its vast territory and natural wealth would naturally lead to prosperity. However, the reality described by the author is one of immediate and profound crisis. The war had decimated the population (over half a million dead), destroyed the mining industry (the economic engine), and ruined agriculture.</p>

        <p>More critically, the new nation lacked political experience and financial solvency. For the next 50 years, Mexico faced a chronic state of bankruptcy, forcing it to rely on predatory foreign loans. This weakness left the country vulnerable to foreign powers. Internally, the era was defined by a violent struggle between two ideological projects: <strong>Federalism</strong> (generally associated with Liberals) and <strong>Centralism</strong> (associated with Conservatives). Between <strong>1821</strong> and <strong>1851</strong> alone, the presidency changed hands more than 40 times.</p>

        <h2>The First Empire and the Federal Republic (1821–1835)</h2>
        <p>The independent nation began as a monarchy, the <strong>Mexican Empire</strong>, under <strong>Agustín de Iturbide</strong>. This was consistent with the <strong>Plan of Iguala</strong>, which sought to maintain social stability. However, <strong>Iturbide</strong> clashed with Congress over the budget and the army. Lacking funds and support, he dissolved Congress, sparking a rebellion. <strong>Iturbide</strong> abdicated in <strong>1823</strong>, and the monarchy experiment failed.</p>

        <p>A Constituent Congress was called, leading to the <strong>Constitution of 1824</strong>. This document established Mexico as a <strong>Federal Republic</strong> (modeled partially on the <strong>United States</strong>) but maintained Catholicism as the sole religion to appease the Conservatives. <strong>Guadalupe Victoria</strong> became the first president and was the only one in this era to complete his full four-year term.</p>

        <p>However, political divisions deepened. In the absence of established political parties, Masonic lodges filled the void: the <strong>Yorkinos</strong> (Liberal, federalist, anti-Spanish) and the <strong>Escoceses</strong> (Conservative, centralist). The first peaceful transition of power failed in <strong>1828</strong> when the loser of the election (<strong>Vicente Guerrero</strong>) used military force to take the presidency. This set a dangerous precedent: the use of coups to resolve political disputes.</p>

        <p>Spain attempted to reconquer Mexico in <strong>1829</strong> but was defeated by General <strong>Antonio López de Santa Anna</strong>, who emerged as a national hero.</p>

        <h2>The Centralist Experiment and the Loss of Texas (1835–1846)</h2>
        <p>By the mid-1830s, the Liberal federal system was perceived as a failure due to constant disorder. The pendulum swung to the Conservatives, who established a <strong>Centralist Republic</strong> under the <strong>"Seven Laws" (Siete Leyes)</strong> of <strong>1836</strong>. This system abolished state autonomy, turning states into "departments" controlled from <strong>Mexico City</strong>.</p>

        <p>This centralization provided a pretext for the colonization of <strong>Texas</strong>. Although the root causes were the influx of American immigrants and their desire to maintain slavery (which Mexico had abolished), the Texans used the repeal of the federal constitution to justify their rebellion. <strong>Santa Anna</strong> marched north to crush the revolt but, after the victory at the <strong>Alamo</strong>, was captured at <strong>San Jacinto</strong>. To save his life, he signed treaties recognizing Texan independence, though the Mexican Congress refused to ratify them. <strong>Texas</strong> became a de facto independent republic in <strong>1836</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The War with the United States (1846–1848)</h2>
        <p>The author identifies this conflict as the defining tragedy of 19th-century Mexico. The <strong>United States</strong>, driven by the doctrine of "Manifest Destiny," annexed Texas in <strong>1845</strong>. A border dispute (<strong>Nueces River</strong> vs. <strong>Rio Grande</strong>) served as the spark for war.</p>

        <p>Mexico was totally unprepared: the army was poorly equipped, the treasury was empty, and political factions continued to fight each other even while the enemy was on Mexican soil. The U.S. invaded on multiple fronts. In <strong>1847</strong>, General <strong>Winfield Scott</strong> landed in <strong>Veracruz</strong> and marched to Mexico City. Despite fierce resistance at battles like <strong>Churubusco</strong> and <strong>Chapultepec</strong>, the capital fell in <strong>September 1847</strong>.</p>

        <p>In <strong>1848</strong>, the <strong>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</strong> was signed. Mexico lost more than half its territory, including <strong>California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah</strong>, and parts of <strong>Colorado</strong>. The trauma of this defeat discredited the Conservative/Centralist leadership and sparked a desire for a total overhaul of the system.</p>

        <h2>The Liberal Reform (1854–1861)</h2>
        <p>After the war, <strong>Santa Anna</strong> returned to power as a dictator, but he was ousted in <strong>1855</strong> by the <strong>Revolution of Ayutla</strong>, led by a new generation of Liberals (<strong>Benito Juárez</strong>, <strong>Melchor Ocampo</strong>, <strong>Miguel Lerdo de Tejada</strong>). They believed the only way to save Mexico was to strip the Church and the Army of their colonial-era privileges (fueros) and create a modern, secular state.</p>

        <p>They enacted the <strong>Constitution of 1857</strong>, which guaranteed individual rights, equality before the law, and freedom of speech. It also incorporated the <strong>Ley Lerdo</strong>, which forced the Church and indigenous communities to sell their property, aiming to create a class of small private landowners.</p>

        <p>The Conservatives, backed by the Church hierarchy, rejected the Constitution. This triggered the <strong>War of Reform (1858–1861)</strong>, also known as the <strong>Three Years' War</strong>. It was a brutal civil war with two simultaneous governments: the Conservative one in <strong>Mexico City</strong> and the Liberal one (led by <strong>Benito Juárez</strong>) in <strong>Veracruz</strong>. The Liberals eventually won, largely because they controlled the customs revenues at the port of Veracruz.</p>

        <h2>The French Intervention and the Second Empire (1861–1867)</h2>
        <p>The Liberal victory was short-lived. The state was bankrupt, and <strong>Juárez</strong> suspended payment on foreign debts. In response, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Britain</strong>, and <strong>Spain</strong> sent fleets to <strong>Veracruz</strong>. While <strong>Britain</strong> and <strong>Spain</strong> negotiated and withdrew, <strong>Napoleon III</strong> of <strong>France</strong> saw an opportunity to establish a puppet monarchy in the Americas to check U.S. power.</p>

        <p>The French army marched inland. Although they were famously defeated on <strong>May 5, 1862 (Cinco de Mayo)</strong>, at <strong>Puebla</strong>, they reinforced and eventually took <strong>Mexico City</strong>. A group of Mexican Conservatives traveled to Europe and offered the crown to the Austrian Archduke <strong>Maximilian of Habsburg</strong>.</p>

        <p>Maximilian and his wife Carlota arrived in <strong>1864</strong> to establish the <strong>Second Empire</strong>. Ironically, Maximilian proved to be a liberal at heart; he refused to return the nationalized Church property, alienating his Conservative allies. Meanwhile, <strong>Juárez</strong> kept the Republican government alive, moving constantly in the north.</p>

        <p>The geopolitical tide turned in <strong>1865</strong>. The U.S. Civil War ended, allowing the U.S. to demand a French withdrawal. <strong>Napoleon III</strong>, facing threats from Prussia in Europe, pulled his troops out of Mexico. Without French bayonets, Maximilian's empire collapsed. He was captured and executed in <strong>Querétaro in 1867</strong>, alongside his conservative generals <strong>Miramón</strong> and <strong>Mejía</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Restored Republic (1867–1876)</h2>
        <p>The execution of <strong>Maximilian Habsbergo</strong> marked the "Second Independence" of Mexico. <strong>Benito Juárez</strong> returned to <strong>Mexico City</strong>, symbolizing the triumph of the Republic and the Liberal project.</p>

        <p>During the <strong>Restored Republic</strong>, <strong>Juárez</strong> and his successor, <strong>Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada</strong>, attempted to modernize the country. They focused on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1. Civilian Rule: Trying to reduce the size and political power of the army.</li>
            <li>2. Education: Establishing the <strong>National Preparatory School</strong> under the positivist philosophy of <strong>Gabino Barreda</strong> ("Order and Progress") to replace religious education.</li>
            <li>3. Infrastructure: Initiating the construction of the railroad between <strong>Veracruz</strong> and <strong>Mexico City</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, political peace remained elusive. The "heroes" of the war against France felt excluded from power by Juárez's civilian administrators. When Juárez ran for re-election in <strong>1871</strong>, and <strong>Lerdo</strong> in <strong>1876</strong>, they faced accusations of wanting to perpetuate themselves in power.</p>

        <p>One of the dissatisfied military heroes was <strong>Porfirio Díaz</strong>. In <strong>1876</strong>, under the <strong>Plan of Tuxtepec</strong> (ironically using the slogan "Effective Suffrage, No Re-election"), Díaz rebelled against <strong>Lerdo de Tejada</strong>. Díaz's military victory ended the era of the Restored Republic and began the long period of stability and dictatorship known as the <strong>Porfiriato</strong>.</p>
