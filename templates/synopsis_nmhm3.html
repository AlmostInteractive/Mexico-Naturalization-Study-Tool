        <h1>3. The Bourbon Reforms and Independence (1760 - 1821)</h1>

        <h2>Introduction: The Modernization of the Empire</h2>
        <p>This period marks a drastic transformation in the relationship between Spain and its American possessions. In <strong>1760</strong>, New Spain was a mature, semi-autonomous kingdom. By <strong>1821</strong>, it was an independent nation. The catalyst for this change was the ascent of the <strong>Bourbon dynasty</strong> in Spain, which sought to transform a loosely managed empire into a centralized, modern colonial state focused on efficiency and revenue extraction.</p>

        <h2>The Bourbon Reforms (<strong>1760–1808</strong>)</h2>
        <p>Under King <strong>Charles III</strong>, the Spanish Crown launched an ambitious program known as the <strong>Bourbon Reforms</strong>. The goal was to reclaim power from the local elites (<strong>Criollos</strong>) and the Church, who had grown too powerful under the previous <strong>Hapsburg</strong> administration. The Crown sent <strong>José de Gálvez</strong> as a "Visitor General" to inspect and restructure the colony.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Political and Administrative Changes</strong><br>
        The most significant change was the introduction of the <strong>Intendancy System</strong>. The Viceroyalty was divided into twelve jurisdictions managed by <strong>Intendants</strong>. These officials were usually <strong>Peninsulares</strong> (Spaniards born in Spain) appointed directly by the King. Their job was to break the corrupt networks of local mayors (<strong>alcaldes mayores</strong>) and streamline tax collection. Furthermore, the Crown systematically removed Criollos from high positions in the <strong>Audiencia</strong> (high court) and treasury, replacing them with Peninsulares. This bred deep resentment among the Criollo elite, who felt they were being treated as second-class subjects in their own land.</p>

        <p><strong>2. The Attack on the Church</strong><br>
        The Bourbons viewed the Church—specifically the <strong>Jesuit</strong> order—as a "state within a state" that rivaled the King's authority. In <strong>1767</strong>, the Crown ordered the <strong>Expulsion of the Jesuits</strong>. This was a traumatic event for New Spain. The Jesuits were the educators of the Criollo elite and were deeply integrated into the social fabric. Riots broke out in several cities, which were brutally suppressed by <strong>Gálvez</strong>. This event severed the emotional tie between many subjects and the Crown.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Economic and Military Reforms</strong><br>
        To maximize profit, the Crown ended the monopoly of the Mexico City merchant guild and opened "free trade" (<strong>comercio libre</strong>) between various ports in the empire. While this boosted trade volume, it disrupted established local economies. Mining was heavily subsidized to increase silver production, which successfully generated massive revenue. Additionally, a standing colonial army was established for the first time. Ironically, this army, designed to defend the colony, provided military training to the very Criollos (like <strong>Allende</strong> and <strong>Aldama</strong>) who would later lead the war for independence.</p>

        <h2>The Crisis of <strong>1808</strong></h2>
        <p>The stability of New Spain shattered due to events in Europe. In <strong>1808</strong>, <strong>Napoleon Bonaparte</strong> invaded Spain, forcing King Charles IV and his son Ferdinand VII to abdicate. Napoleon placed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the Spanish throne.</p>

        <p>In Mexico City, a constitutional crisis erupted. The question was: Without a legitimate King, who holds sovereignty?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Criollos</strong> (led by the City Council or <strong>Ayuntamiento</strong>) argued that in the absence of the King, sovereignty reverted to the people (the Kingdom of New Spain) until the King returned. They proposed a provisional autonomous government.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Peninsulares</strong> (led by the Audiencia) viewed this as a covert attempt at independence. They argued that officials appointed by Spain should remain in charge.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In <strong>September 1808</strong>, a group of armed Peninsulares launched a coup, arresting the sympathetic Viceroy <strong>Iturrigaray</strong> and imprisoning the Criollo leaders. This act of force closed the door to legal political change, convincing many Criollos that their only path to power was through conspiracy and armed revolt.</p>

        <h2>The War of Independence (<strong>1810–1821</strong>)</h2>
        <p>The war is generally divided into four phases:</p>

        <p><strong>1. The Outbreak: Hidalgo (<strong>1810–1811</strong>)</strong><br>
        After the <strong>1808 coup</strong>, conspiracies proliferated. The most famous was in <strong>Querétaro</strong>, involving <strong>Miguel Hidalgo</strong> (a parish priest), <strong>Ignacio Allende</strong> (a militia officer), and others. When the plot was discovered, Hidalgo made his famous <strong>Grito de Dolores</strong> on <strong>September 16, 1810</strong>.</p>

        <p>Hidalgo did not lead a disciplined army, but a massive, angry mob of indigenous peasants and workers. They viewed the war as a chance for revenge against centuries of oppression by the "<strong>Gachupines</strong>" (Spaniards). The violence was extreme; the massacre at the <strong>Alhóndiga de Granaditas</strong> in <strong>Guanajuato</strong> terrified the wealthy Criollos, causing them to support the Royalist government for protection. Although Hidalgo threatened Mexico City, he retreated and was eventually defeated. He was captured and executed in <strong>1811</strong>, but the spark had been lit.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Organization: Morelos (<strong>1811–1815</strong>)</strong><br>
        Leadership passed to another priest, <strong>José María Morelos</strong>. Unlike Hidalgo, Morelos was a brilliant military strategist who organized a disciplined army. He took control of the south and key ports. Politically, Morelos clarified the movement's goals. In his document <strong>Sentimientos de la Nación</strong> (Sentiments of the Nation), he declared total independence from Spain (no longer claiming to fight for Ferdinand VII), the abolition of slavery and the caste system, and equality before the law. This culminated in the <strong>Constitution of Apatzingán</strong> (<strong>1814</strong>). However, the restored Spanish King sent reinforcements, and Morelos was captured and executed in <strong>1815</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Resistance and Guerilla War (<strong>1815–1820</strong>)</strong><br>
        With Morelos gone, the insurgency fragmented into isolated guerrilla bands hiding in the mountains. The most prominent leader remaining was <strong>Vicente Guerrero</strong> in the south. The new Viceroy offered pardons, and many insurgents surrendered. By <strong>1820</strong>, the movement seemed militarily defeated, reduced to minor skirmishes.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Consummation: Iturbide (<strong>1820–1821</strong>)</strong><br>
        Independence eventually came from an unexpected direction: the counter-revolution. In <strong>1820</strong>, a liberal revolt in Spain forced King Ferdinand VII to accept the liberal <strong>Constitution of Cadiz</strong>.</p>

        <p>The conservative elites in Mexico (Church hierarchy, high military officers, and wealthy merchants) were horrified. They feared the new Spanish government would strip away their privileges (<strong>fueros</strong>) and attack the Church. They decided that Independence was now the only way to preserve the old colonial order.</p>

        <p><strong>Agustín de Iturbide</strong>, a Royalist general who had spent years fighting the insurgents, saw his opportunity. He switched sides and reached out to the insurgent leader <strong>Vicente Guerrero</strong>. Together, they forged the <strong>Plan of Iguala</strong> in <strong>1821</strong>. This plan offered the "<strong>Three Guarantees</strong>":</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Religion</strong>: Roman Catholicism as the sole faith.</li>
            <li><strong>Union</strong>: Equality between Americans and Europeans.</li>
            <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Mexico as a constitutional monarchy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This compromise united all factions. The Royalist army collapsed as officers defected to Iturbide. On <strong>September 27, 1821</strong>, the <strong>Army of the Three Guarantees</strong> marched triumphantly into Mexico City. Mexico was independent, but the nation was born out of a conservative compromise that left many social structures of the colony intact, setting the stage for the conflicts of the 19th century.</p>
